# MT-TD-VRP
The real world data from Singapore Coca-Cola.

File 1: Customer2ID.txt
  The number of customers in data files are serial numbers generated by Coca-Cola. eg. 502785770.
  This file will map such serial numbers to the Virtual Number from 1 to 1987.
  
File 2: ODMatrix.txt
  This file is a distance matrix file. 
  Each row contains three number (a,b,c), where a and b are customers' Virtual Number and 
  c is the distance in real-life between a and b.
  
 Files in "cola":
    These files are the data using in this work.
   
    First line: Customer number need to be served.
    Second line: Capacity of the Vehicle.
    Third line: Maximum distance limit of each trip.

    Five time zone with different speed profile: 
    eg. " 0.0 120.0 0.0 0.5" : means from time 0 to time 120, the speed is set to 0.5

    [speed choose matrix]
    For each arc, it has a speed profile.
    eg.  the link (0,4) is assigned with speed profile 1, which is given by [Speed 1].
    
 Files in "ans":  
  
 Each file is a set of solutions obtained by MT-SPlit algorithm. 
 
Each solution is composed by [N_vehilces, Travel Cost, [route split into trips],[each trip's departure time and arrival time].
